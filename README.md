## Intro

[**Huffman Coding**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding) is a widely used method of lossless data compression. It was developed by [David A. Huffman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_A._Huffman) while he was a Ph.D. student at MIT, and it was published in his seminal paper in 1952. The algorithm is used to compress data by assigning variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies. Characters that occur more frequently are given shorter codes, while less frequent characters are assigned longer codes. This approach reduces the overall size of the encoded data.
